    "about" : "I'm an experienced Data Scientist, Machine Learning Egineer and Python Software Developer. I've deployed all kinds of high performance regression and classification problems to a production setting. I specialize in building validated, scalable models and machine learning systems capable of supporting and automating real business processes. I write thoughtfully tested, maintable, production-grade code and build empircally validated models that perform as expected once deployed to a live setting. I also specialize in Time-Series and Recommender systems.",
